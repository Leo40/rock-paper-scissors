**Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock**

This is a classic Rock Paper Scissors game with a twist, based on the popular TV show, The Big Bang Theory. In this game, you can choose between five different options: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock. Each option has a set of rules that determines whether it wins, loses, or ties with the other options.

The game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a simple user interface that allows you to select your choice by clicking on the corresponding button. The game will then generate a random computer choice and display the winner, as well as the score.
